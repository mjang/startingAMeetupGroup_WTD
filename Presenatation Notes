Slide 1

I'm honored to be here among you, web developers who have created some fabulous code, code that may solve some of 
the critical problems of our time -- or maybe that critical application that can help you get that startup off the 
ground.

Slide 

I know, a lot of you are proud of your self-documenting code. And yes, when I take the time to read self-documenting code, 
it can help me understand the intent of an application. However, when code starts getting real, when it goes beyond say
a few hundred lines, it starts looking like this -- a picture of human DNA

Slide 

I'm Mike Jang, Senior Technical Writer for a company called ForgeRock. We create Identity Management software as 
web applications. I spend most of my time "reverse engineering" the code that goes into those web applications.

In this talk, I'll describe a systematic method for documentation -- with steps that anyone can follow. 

Slide 

Now you've created a web app. You know that it's the best thing since sliced bread. You want to tell the world about it. 
The first question is: HOW

You can start writing about your web app. You could blog. You could even create a screen-based YouTube where you describe
the fabulous things that your potential customers can do. Whatever media you select, the principles are the same

Slide: 

Here are the big picture steps -- we'll go through them, one at a time. And yes, I'll include code snippets where appropriate

Slide: 

This is your chance to tell the world, in a few short words, why your software
It's a chance to show empathy -- in the open source world, it your chance to describe what itch you're scratching
  Presumably, others have the same itch. 

Linus Torvalds made it clear in his initial emails on Linux
Back in the 1990s, corporate America was taking UNIX away from us
Linus described the need for a community operating system
He presented Linux as a solution

We listened, and the world was forever changed.

Slide: 

The way you describe a "Need" is important. Keep it simple. You're not writing a novel, you're presenting your software
to the broadest possible audience.

So when you present a "need", write a short, declarative sentence.

My webapp {verb} {feature}

Look at some of these verbs. When you start describing your webapp, think of this. 
What's the main feature of your software. 
What's the name of your webapp
What does it do?

Get that right, and you'll have the introduction that you need.
